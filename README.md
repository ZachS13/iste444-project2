# iste444-project2

## Description
For this project, you'll create a custom web app stack (something other than LAMP and MEAN), which serves up a RESTful API and a client app for a really basic inventory-handling system.
- We chose to create a stack similar to a MERN stack, but swapped out the MongoDB database with a PostgreSQL database.
